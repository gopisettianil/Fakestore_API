# Shopping Store Website

## Overview
This project is a simple e-commerce website designed using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. The website uses data from [FakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to display a variety of products categorized under different sections like Electronics, Jewelry, Men's Clothing, and Women's Clothing. Users can view product details, filter products by category, search for specific products, and add items to a shopping cart.

## Features
- **Dynamic Product Display**: Products are fetched from FakeStore API and displayed dynamically.
- **Category Filtering**: Users can filter products based on selected categories.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for products by category name.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to their cart, view cart items, and see a preview of the selected items.
- **Responsive Design**: The site layout is responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience across various devices.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the website.
- **CSS**: Styling with Bootstrap for responsive and visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript**: Handling dynamic data fetching, user interactions, and DOM manipulation.
